# Peer-2-Paws

---

This application utilizes multiple front and back-end packages including handlebars, sequelize, & vue.js to render a peer-2-peer pet adoption site. The site allows users to create a new pet entry when a pet is up for adoption and allows potential adopters to search for pets, register for updates, apply to adopt a pet, and research cat and dog breed information.
