# Peer-2-Paws

---

## Description

A peer-2-peer pet adoption site that allows users to search for pets and apply for adoption.

---

## Motivation

Considering the large number of pets needing to be adopted and the maxed out resources of local pet adoption centers, this site allows users to connect directly for pet adoption purposes.

---

## Results

The site is functional and allows users to apply for adoption, post animals up for adoption, sign up for updates and newsletters, and view cat & dog breed information.

---

## Team Efforts

* Jon Godwin completed the environment variable usage & the car and dog breed sites
* Jon Keopagna worked on the Sequelize ORM to display the pet information via handlebars
* Gil Orcilla worked on the HTML & JS files and functions
* Jules Wood completed the handlebars & html formatting and file structure

---

## Challenges

* Getting forms for inputting data to work with handlebars
* Completing the usage of environment variables and .env file
* Completing the vue.js info for the cat & dog breed sites

---

## Improvements

Given enough time, we would have created an authentication methodology so users could stay logged in and research pets more in-depth. We would also have created additional functionality to upload images of new pets being posted for adoption.
